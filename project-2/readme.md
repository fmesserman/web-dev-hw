## Forrest Messerman Project 2

Hw-01: This project is already confusing just like the last one.
It's not that hard to follow instructions but coding is just confusing.
I think i'm getting it but I'm still confused on how to use atom
with github. It is not very intuitive at all.

Hw-03: This assignment was much easier because I have started to pick up HTML
much better and actually start to get my feet under me hopefully. This class so
has been a significant challenge but I think I'm making improvements.
