# my first **README.md**
## *Forrest Messerman*

I felt very overwhlemed in starting to use GitHub. I think I'm stating to get it down but it was all very confusing at first and I was really stressed out about the class.

1. The github interface and how to use atom with github was fairly difficult to start doing.
2. Markdown actually ended up being a lot easier to us than I thought it would be.

*  I do however have some experience with HTML so that part wasn't that hard to figure out.
*  I was having trouble connecting my screenshot to the readme but I think I got it.
